    "\n",
    "In the online article: [A one-line algorithm for Julian Date](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1983IAPPP..13...16F)\n",
    "we find an old and very compact formula for programmable calculators to calculate a Julian Date given a day, month and year.   \n",
    "A Julian Date is in fact a\n",
    "day number corresponding to the number of elapsed days since the beginning of a cycle of 7980 years.\n",
    "That makes it a useful tool to calculate how many days there are between two dates.\n",
    "The one-line algorithm is valid for the period that started in 1582 with the Gregorian calendar.\n",
    "The formula from the article is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "``JD = 367*Y -7*(Y+(M+9)/12)/4 - 3*((Y+(M-9)/7)/100 + 1)/4 + (275*M)/9 + D + 1721029-0.5``\n",
    "\n",
    "The article notes: **It is important to note that after all divisions in this expression only that portion of the\n",
    "quotient to the left of the decimal point is retained and that the quotient is not rounded off.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use your notebook to develop an implementation of this formula.\n",
    "* Then create a Python script called ``JD.py`` that asks a user to enter day, month and year. For this date, the script calculates the Julian Date (JD) and prints it. The day can be entered as a floating point number to allow for fractional days.\n",
    "* Upload your JD.py to your GitHub account -- ``PROGNUM-repo``, and set your account to be public. In your answer, provide your GitHub repository link. \n",
    "* The article provides a test case: the Julian Date for January 4, 1700 is 2341975.5.    \n",
    "  Use your code to get the correct result, and attach your screen shot in this notebook.&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "Extend the program on the notebook, so that it can calculate the number of days between two dates in the Gregorian calendar. What is your age expressed in days?\n",
